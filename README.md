## Description 

This was a very interesting assignment. I felt like it was a Jigsaw puzzle and I was trying to figure out but I was messing up even thought I knew the answer.
My inspiration for this file is something they tought us in the first class "Be Persistent/You can do this". I had to learn to trust myself and be really patient...

I love challenges and puzzles; and I took this assignment felt like that. I guess I want to prove myself I'm capable of learning web developing and make this my career. 

## Challenges

Definitely the part about making sure the three links work appropriately. I have to admit I was getting really desperate but at the end I was able to figure out.
Consolidating was also difficult but with time and patient I was able to finished.


## Tools 

I used W3schools, youtube tutorials, MDN web docs and most important my notes and class work.
